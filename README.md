# Portfolio Optimization using Lagrangian for Positive Weight Portfolio


## Simulation description
- The total number of trading days considered to calculate a portfolio is 252 days i.e. number of trading days in a year.
- The plot uses the historic data from Jan 1, 2019 to Dec 31, 2019 to create the initial portfolio.
